    <h1>List of nonprofits</h1>

    <h2> Alliance for the great lakes </h2>
    <p>
      This 45-year-old organization is a powerful force helping to protect the Great Lakes through advocacy, education, and restoration. And it’s achieving tangible results. For example, it helped push for the groundbreaking commitment made in June by the governors of Michigan and Ohio and the premier of Ontario to reduce pollution flowing into Lake Erie by 40 percent. And thanks in part to the organization’s work, last year Illinois became the first state to pass a law phasing out the manufacture and sale of products, such as body scrubs containing microbeads, that cause pollution in the water supply and can be mistaken for food by marine organisms. The group’s annual fall Adopt-a-Beach cleanup brings together nearly 15,000 volunteers in all eight Great Lakes states to pick up some 52,000 pounds of debris from beaches and shorelines (and provides researchers with valuable data about sources of pollution). Next up: fighting to restore the natural divide between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basin.

    <h2>Gilda's club Chicago</h2>
    <p>
        Saturday Night Live cast member Gilda Radner famously said that having cancer gave her membership in an elite club she’d rather not belong to. After the comedian died in 1989, her loved ones founded this nonprofit, which in the Chicagoland area provides more than 350 free activities each month: support and networking groups, social events, arts and crafts, and family programs. Membership is open to those with or affected by cancer, including friends and loved ones. Visits to the Chicago location (there are separate entities in several cities across the country) have more than doubled over the past three years, to some 25,000.

    <h2>Bridge communities</h2>
    <p>
        More than just a housing program, Bridge envelops its clients—homeless families and individuals in DuPage County—in support: two years in a comfortably furnished apartment, financial coaching, career advice, interview preparation, therapy, and even nutritional counseling to help them get back on track.

    <h2>Cara program</h2>
    <p>
        Consider Cara an on-ramp for the unemployed. The rigorous program—training lasts an average of four to five months and teaches skills such as team building and financial literacy—prepares its graduates (5,000 since 1991) to enter the work force and stay there. Cara also runs for-profit social enterprises Cleanslate, a neighborhood beautification business, and TCP Staffing, a temp firm where the program’s graduates can get valuable job experience. Beyond that, the organization has partnerships with a whopping 120-plus Chicago-area employers, including Marriott, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Eataly.
